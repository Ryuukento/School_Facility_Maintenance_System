     * KNOWN BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: insufficient stock no longer blocks approval,
     * it blocks release. An Administrator can now approve a dispatch the

    /**
     * TASK 13 — Dispatch Release Assignment Workflow.
     *
     * This is now THE inventory-deduction path for a dispatch. Task 1's stock
     * validation, its InventoryTransaction('deploy') pipeline, its
     * duplicate-release guard and its row locking were moved here from
     * approveDispatch() — moved, not copied, so there is still exactly one
     * place a dispatch deducts stock.
     *
     * Compared to the pre-Task-13 version of this method, three things were
     * hardened, because it is no longer a rarely-taken legacy path:
     *   1. the dispatch row is now locked with lockForUpdate() (it previously
     *      had no lock at all, so two concurrent releases could both pass the
     *      status guard);
     *   2. the stock check moved INSIDE the transaction (it previously ran
     *      before DB::transaction() opened, against unlocked rows);
     *   3. the InventoryTransaction duplicate guard from Task 1 was brought
     *      across, so a dispatch that somehow already has 'deploy' rows cannot
     *      be deducted twice even if its status were wrong.
     *
     * The actual quantity / reserved_quantity arithmetic still belongs to
     * InventoryTransactionObserver, exactly as before — no stock math is
     * duplicated in this service.
     *
