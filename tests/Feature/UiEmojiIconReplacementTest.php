/**
 * TASK 7 — UI emojis replaced with proper interface icons.
 *
 * The Dean flagged that the interface used emoji characters as icons
 * (📦 Inventory, 🔔 Notifications, 🗑️ Delete, ✓ Approved …). Emoji render as
 * colourful, platform-dependent pictures that vary between Windows, macOS and
 * Android, which is precisely what made the UI look unprofessional.
 *
 * The application already had an icon convention — hand-written inline
 * <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
 * in the sidebar and header. TASK 7 did NOT introduce a library, a CDN or an
 * npm package; it consolidated that existing convention into a registry
 * (includes/icon-paths.php) with two renderers that read from it:
 *
 *   - ui_icon()        — PHP, for server-rendered markup
 *   - UIIcons.svg()    — JS, for the many views this app paints from script
 *
 * The registry is serialised into the page by header.php, so the two renderers
 * physically cannot drift apart.
 *
 * These tests pin down:
 *   1. the registry and both renderers exist and agree;
 *   2. every icon follows one visual contract (24x24, stroke, currentColor),
 *      which is what makes Light and Dark theme work with no per-theme rule;
 *   3. icons are decorative by default, so screen readers do not hear a
 *      redundant name next to an already-visible label;
 *   4. icon-only controls kept a real accessible name;
 *   5. the emoji that were acting as interface icons are gone from the
 *      surfaces that render them;
 *   6. no label text was reworded in the process;
 *   7. the TASK 6 / 6A Inventory submenu is untouched;
 *   8. no backend file was dragged into a presentation change.
