/**
 * TASK 101 — Buildings Overview becomes a sidebar module, and its search
 * becomes a three-level Building -> Floor -> Room hierarchy.
 *
 * Two requirements from the Dean/checker:
 *
 *  1. Buildings Overview must not be presented as a Dashboard shortcut; it is
 *     its own sidebar destination.
 *  2. The search must be progressive and scoped: Floor search is limited to the
 *     selected Building, Room search to the selected Floor of that Building.
 *
 * The UX half of requirement 2 was then corrected: the three controls must all
 * be usable from the OUTER Buildings Overview view, as a persistent cascading
 * filter toolbar. Narrowing to a floor must not require opening a building, and
 * narrowing to a room must not require opening a floor. The tests that used to
 * pin the floor search to the drill-down floor level were rewritten for that
 * corrected requirement — the underlying hierarchy and server-side scoping
 * assertions they protected are all still here, and there are now more of them.
 *
 * What this file pins down:
 *
 *  - The sidebar entry exists exactly once and links to the pre-existing
 *    /buildings-overview route (no duplicate page, no duplicate nav item).
 *  - dashboard.php's pure navigation card is gone, while the three dashboards
 *    that show a real building COUNT keep their stat cards — those display data
 *    rather than merely linking, so they were deliberately left alone.
 *  - All three filters render inside the outer toolbar, and none of the filter
 *    handlers navigates into a drill-down level.
 *  - The scoping is proven against the real API with real rows, not just by
 *    reading markup: floors of another building and rooms of another floor or
 *    another building cannot appear, and a mismatched building/floor pair
 *    yields nothing.
 *  - The parent-change reset rules hold in the page's own JS.
 *
 * RBAC is deliberately NOT re-specified here. BuildingsRbacTest already owns
 * the full TASK 35 matrix (all three roles may view; only super_admin may
 * mutate). The two tests at the bottom assert only that THIS task did not move
 * those boundaries.
